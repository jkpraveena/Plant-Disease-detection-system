AI-Based Plant Disease Detection Using CNN

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model analyzes visual symptoms and provides early diagnosis, helping farmers and urban gardeners take timely preventive measures. The system is trained on a diverse dataset to recognize various plant diseases, enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability. Integrated with a user-friendly interface, the solution ensures accessible and efficient disease detection, supporting both traditional and urban farming practices.
